## What is Novadesk?

**Novadesk** is a lightweight, open-source **desktop widget platform** for Windows that allows developers to create beautiful, interactive widgets using **JavaScript**.

It offers a powerful yet simple API for building custom widgets that run directly on the **Windows desktop**, without the complexity or overhead of a full desktop application framework.

Novadesk is ideal for developers who want **fine-grained control**, **high performance**, and **clean integration** with the desktop while keeping their workflow simple and flexible.
